# tSNE
t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) is a unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction and data visualization technique. The math behind t-SNE is quite complex but the idea is simple. It embeds the points from a higher dimension to a lower dimension trying to preserve the neighborhood of that point. I compared PCA and t-SNE methodology for dimensionality reduction. Then I demonstrated how to use and tune t-SNE model in Python.
